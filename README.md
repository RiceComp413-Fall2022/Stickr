## Pitch
Over the last few years image generation deep learning models have become more accurate and accessible. There is a unique opportunity to generate digital art on-demand to match any query a user inputs. We propose a website where a user can enter a prompt for a sticker design they would want, and then we display a page of image results generated by an AI system like DALL-E. Furthermore, we want to enable that user to interact with the image generation AI, which could include a more hands-on approach to prompt generation, and image editing tools. Furthermore, DALL-E is trained to return images, giving us the opportunity to apply our own AI model (trained through transfer learning) to convert the images DALL-E outputs to images that are suitable for stickers.
